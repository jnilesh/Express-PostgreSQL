It has instructions on how to set up a small webserver.</p><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><p>1) At your terminal in your project directory, run <code>npm install express pg<br></code>2) Download the <strong>index.js</strong> file attached to this lecture and place it in your project directory<br>3) Open up the index.js file and update the <strong>user</strong> and <strong>password</strong> on lines 8 and 9 to the username and password that you use to connect to your PG database. If you are on macOS, the user is your username and the password is probably an empty string. If you are on windows, the user is probably <strong>postgres</strong> and the password is probably whatever you set it to during the initial Postgres install.<br>4) Save the file<br>5) At the terminal, run <code>node index.js<br></code>6) Open your browser and navigate to <strong>http://localhost:3050/posts</strong><br>7) Try to create a new post.
